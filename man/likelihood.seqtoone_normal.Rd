\title{Use a Normal likelihood for a seq-to-one recurrent network}
\usage{
likelihood.seqtoone_normal(chain, sig_prior)
}
\arguments{
\item{chain}{Network structure obtained using \code{link{Chain}}}

\item{sig_prior}{A prior distribution for sigma defined using
\code{\link{Gamma}}, \code{link{InverGamma}},
\code{\link{Truncated}}, \code{\link{Normal}}}
}
\value{
see \code{\link{likelihood.feedforward_normal}}
}
\description{
This creates a likelihood of the form
\deqn{y_i \sim Normal(net(x_i), \sigma), i=1,...,N}
Here \eqn{x_i} is a subsequence which will be fed through the recurrent
network to obtain the final output \eqn{net(x_i) = \hat{y}_i}. Thus, if
one has a single time series, and splits the single time series into subsequences
of length K which are then used to predict the next output of the time series, then
each \eqn{x_i} consists of K consecutive observations of the time series. In a sense
one constraints the maximum memory length of the network this way.
